I am a Greek undergraduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Class of 2028). I have experience in Robotics and Autonomy through [personal projects](https://github.com/pliam1105) and [build teams](https://arcturus.mit.edu/), as well as conducting research in MIT labs ([LAMM](https://lamm.mit.edu/), [AUV Lab](https://seagrant.mit.edu/auv-lab/), [SPARK Lab](https://web.mit.edu/sparklab/)), and I'm specializing in Perception, Sensor Fusion, and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). I am familiar with the Robot Operating System and software packages like PCL and OpenCV. I have also conducted research in technical AI safety, specifically [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12004), as well as [Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning](https://medium.com/@pliam1105/risk-sensitive-reinforcement-learning-with-applications-in-autonomous-driving-part-1-93eebad62823). I am a beginner to intermediate guitar and football enthusiast and have played basketball for 6 years.
