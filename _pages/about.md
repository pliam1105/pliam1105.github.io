I am a Greek undergraduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Class of 2028). I have been interested in Robotics (with experience in the Robotics Operating System and Arduino/Raspberry Pi), Internet of Things, Machine Learning, as well as app and website development, and I have made various [projects](https://github.com/pliam1105). I have also conducted [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12004) in technical AI safety, specifically Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. I am a beginner guitar enthusiast and have played basketball for 6 years.
