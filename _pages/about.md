I am a 18-year old High School student, currently taking a gap year, as I want to gain life experiences and form my personality in a way that will allow me to enter University with high goals and clearly defined priorities. I have been interested in various sectors of technology, like Robotics, Internet of Things, Machine Learning, as well as app and website development, and I have made various [projects](https://github.com/pliam1105) that help my community. I am a volunteer, have spent 2 weeks in a dog and wildlife shelter, and an active member of various ecological teams. I have also conducted [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12004) in technical AI safety, specifically Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback, as it is a field that intrigued me from the first time that I encountered its implications in the future of our society. I am a beginner guitar enthusiast and have played basketball for 6 years.
